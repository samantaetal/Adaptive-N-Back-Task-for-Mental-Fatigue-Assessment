# Adaptive-N-Back-Task-for-Mental-Fatigue-Assessment
This Repository contains the MATLAB implementation of a novel adaptive N-Back memory recall task to effectively induce and assess mental fatigue.
Sample pre-processed data is available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1visOA_juw2uNxWyjR14H_iE6AnNr282N/view?usp=sharing

Instructions of using the code:
 All codes are written using MATLAB R2024b. 

 To run the experiment, user first need to install Psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) and all of its dependencies as described in the official website. Then they need to download two folders named as 'PVT' and 'nBack' and add the path to matlab session. The script, 'MentalFatigue_Complete_Paradigm.m' utilizes all necessary functions from those two folders to successfully run the experiment. Upon executing the complete paradigm code, users will have the flexibility to adapt the runtime of the PVT and N-Back task.
